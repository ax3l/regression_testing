Start Date: 02/21/18

Author: Patrick Payne

Purpose: Check all of the tests for MAESTRO or CASTRO to see if every
         parameter has been tested at a value different from the
         default value

In order for this script to function: the output of the tests that it is
 looking at should be in a form similar to what is shown below:

[START EXAMPLE]

===============================================================================
 Runtime Parameter Information
===============================================================================
[*] indicates overridden default
[*]             parameter_alpha = 1.000
                  parameter_one = F

[END EXAMPLE]

The '[*]' can be preceeded by a space, as is done in MAESTRO (04/24/18), but
 this is not necessary. The script searches for the keyword "Parameter" in
 to begin reading the parameters immediately following the line "[*] indicates
 overridden default" and so will expect the barrier line and that line as well.

As for the form of the tests, the produce plot files should be compressed in a
 tarfile (".tgz"). This tarfile contains a job_info file where all of the
 runtime parameters that were used in the simulation are listed, in the form
 that was expressed above. The values that were set different from the default
 values are marked with a [*]. This is the feature that we are looking for to
 determine if the quantity is covered.

The basic function of the script is as follows:
 1) All of the test directories are recorded
 2) These directories are checked for a file with the extension ".tgz"
 3) If the file is present, the job_info file is extracted
 4) The parameters are then read from each job_info file
 5) The parameters that occured with a [*] are recorded as covered and the
    others are recorded as not_covered. All duplicates are removed
 6) The problem specific parameters (only used in one simulation) are recorded
 7) The coverage fractions are calculated
 8) The coverage reports are constructed with the list of parameters that were
    not covered, the fraction of total parameters that were covered, and the
    total number of parameters recorded.

Output: Two ".out" files, one that includes any problem specific parameters
 (parameters that are only appear in one test) and one that excludes these
 parameters. The are titled "Coverage.out" and "Coverage-NoSpecific.out",
 respectively.

MAESTRO: There should be ~260 total parameters, this includes the problem
         specific parameters.

CASTRO: There should be ~140 total parameters, this includes the problem
        specific parameters.

Placement: Place the script in the directory where the tests are and execute
           it in there as your CWD

DEVELOPMENT: Add feature for user to specify the test directory on command line
